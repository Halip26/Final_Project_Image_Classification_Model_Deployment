# Final Submission - Image Classification Model Deployment

This repository contains code for training an image classification model and deploying it for inference. The model is built using machine learning techniques and can classify images into predefined categories.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Halip26/ML_Image_Classification.git
    ```

2. Install the necessary Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To train the image classification model, run the following command:

```python
final_project_image_classification_model_deployment.py --train
```

To deploy the model for inference, use:

```python
final_project_image_classification_model_deployment.py --predict <image_path>
```

Replace `<image_path>` with the path to the image you want to classify.
